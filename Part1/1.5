I used this command to create the container;
docker run -d -it --name test ubuntu sh -c 'echo "Input website: "; read website; echo "Searching..."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

It made the container run the given small script in the background, and it also waited for input in its own terminal that was not shown because of the -d flag

After that i ran this code;
docker exec -it test bash

It told the 'test' container to run the command 'bash', and because of the -it flag, it transferred my input/output/other streams into the newly opened terminal inside the container.

After that was done i confirmed that the original program was running with ps aux command, it was, so i basically had different terminal inside the same ubuntu container, and i was free to do anything.

I updated apt;
root@fa8665ba2890:/# apt update

I downloaded curl;
root@fa8665ba2890:/# apt install curl

After that i exited the new terminal with 'exit' command, and attached the terminal to the originally started terminal view with;
docker attach test

Then this happened;
samisaukkonen@Samis-MacBook-Pro:~/git/Docker2019/Part1$ docker attach test
