I used the dockerfile in this folder to create the image with the command;
docker build -t docker-clock .

After that i just ran it normally with;
docker run docker-clock


The Dockerfile CMD command has 3 forms, either ["executable", "param1", "param2", ...], ["param1", "param2", ...] or command, param1 param2 ...
First one runs some executable (like bash or sh) and passes it given params when no input is given from terminal when running image
Second one gives the image some flags to run if none are given by the user
And the third one runs the command given
