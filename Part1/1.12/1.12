I ran both of the images i got from the edited dockerfiles at the same time, frontend with the command;

docker run -d --rm --name front p 5000:5000 front

and backend with;

docker run -d --rm --name back p 8000:8000 back

they are not in the same origin, since their ports are different, so the 
dockerfiles are edited so that they change their api/front URL's accordingly.

This just makes it so that they ping to different urls when certain actions are done.
