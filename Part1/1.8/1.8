I used this command to achieve the desired result;
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/logs.txt:/usr/app/logs.txt --name test devopsdockeruh/first_volume_exercise

at first i just tried to share the whole folder, but then i realized that it overwrites the folder inside the container, so it could not find the actual program to run.

the --rm and --name test flags were put there to make trying and testing easier.
