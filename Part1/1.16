This is the exercise i skipped in this part, there was some problems with pushing to heroku.

It kept complaining about "no basic auth credentials", and the stackoverflow/github issues people have raised made it seem like it would take long time to get working.

Because i was too lazy and started too late to work on this course, i have to save time to start working on other courses too, but luckily im allowed to skip one exercise.
